<div class="tile w-full h-auto">
	Magirator is the successor of the system specific apps Magic Game Tracker for Android and Windows phone. The goal of this
	project is to make this app more accessable and able to add new features in a more coherent way. This app will continue
	to be a simplistic tool to keep track of your Magic the Gathering decks and played games without spending hours selecting
	cards.
